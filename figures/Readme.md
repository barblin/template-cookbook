# Figures, graphs and images

Please use this folder to manage your figures, graphs and images. These resources should support your documentation. Images can, most of the time, help to convey complex topics more easily.

You can include images by referencing them in your template like so:

```bash
![<text>](<path>)
```

- text can be replaced with a description of what is displayed
- path should describe the relative path from your position. In your template it would be ./figures/dummy.jpg
