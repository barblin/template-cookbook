# Template Cookbook

## Responsibility
Software Engineering

## Purpose
This cookbook will serve as a template for future cookbooks and should provide guidance on how to structure, format and name the content of your cookbook.

## Results
By reading these instructions you will be able to create cookbooks yourself. If you follow the guidelines, the cookbook will adhere to the minimum criteria to be accepted as a company cookbook.

## Preconditions
- Knowledge of the Markdown language
- You know what a Cookbook is and what its purpose is

## How tu use?
- Sections or content that is optional will be marked with (o)

## Examples
A cookbook should always have examples. In this template we have separated the 'How to use?' section from the 'Examples' section. This is optional and should only demonstrate to the reader of this template that examples are important and necessary for a cookbook. The 'How to use?' section should either refer to examples in this section or should provide minimal examples itself. Therefore this section can be named 'Examples' or 'Additional Examples' or can be integrated in the 'How to use?' section. But Examples are mandatory.

## Sources (o)
Cite your sources. If you have used code or content of other pages or you reference knowledge from a book, then please provide the original sources. By providing references, you will allow readers to go into more detail about specific topics and also give credit to the original creator. 

## Related Topics (o)
